### Hello, my name is Satyam Patel and I'm currently finishing up my final year @ Lehigh University studying Computer Science & Business

My goal is to implement all of the conceptual knowledge I've gained from courses in Data Structures, Operating System Design, Systems Software, etc., 
into working repositories based on personal hobbies of mine

With the growth of technology and the means to use it, I hope to use this GitHub to showcase my personal demonstrations of awesome projects I've found to be 
worthwhile both for my enjoyment as well as for my drive to learn. 

Aside from my passions in Computer Science, I enjoy hiking, relaxing in the comfort of my house, cooking, and traveling. 
I absolutely love History (mostly Ancient) and can talk about related topics without rest!

I plan on advancing my skillset further in order to work full-time as a Software Engineer, Data Analyst, or a Systems Engineer.
